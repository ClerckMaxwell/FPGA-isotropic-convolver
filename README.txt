Use rgb_txtGen to generate a text file simulating an image that you will need to use within the circuit test bench. After loading everything correctly you can simulate the circuit with your own filtering window, to compare the results obtained from the FPGA circuit with those from MATLAB use the rgb_filter_2 files if you are not using the gray conversion block, otherwise use the rgb2gray file.
