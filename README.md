# FPGA-isotropic-convolver
A totally low-level description of an isotropic convolver for 32x32 RGB images with 8-bit pixels and four types of edge management. The circuit has been implemented and tested on prototype boards and works perfectly at a clock_period of 2.9 ns. it is also possible to convert an image from RGB to gray scale.
